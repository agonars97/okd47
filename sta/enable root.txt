As root, open the /etc/sudoers file.

# visudo
The /etc/sudoers file defines the policies applied by the sudo command.

In the /etc/sudoers file, find the lines that grant sudo access to users in the administrative wheel group.

## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel        ALL=(ALL)       ALL
Make sure the line that starts with %wheel does not have the # comment character before it.
Save any changes, and exit the editor.
Add users you want to grant sudo access to into the administrative wheel group.

 # usermod --append -G wheel username
Replace username with the name of the user.

Verification steps

Verify that the user is added to the administrative wheel group:

# id username
uid=5000(username) gid=5000(_username) groups=5000(username),10(wheel)
24.3. Enabling unprivileged users to run certain commands
You can configure a policy that allows unprivileged user to run certain command on a specific workstation. To configure this policy, you need to edit the sudoers.d file.

Prerequisites

root access
Procedure

As root, create a new sudoers.d directory under /etc/:

# mkdir -p /etc/sudoers.d/
Create a new file in the /etc/sudoers.d directory:

# visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/file-name
Replace file-name with the name of the file you want to create. The file will open automatically.

Add the following line to the newly created file:

username hostname = /path/to/the/command
Replace username with the name of the user. Replace hostname with the name of the host. Replace /path/to/the/command with the absolute path to the command (for example, /usr/bin/yum).

Save any changes, and exit the editor.

Example 24.1. Enabling an unprivileged user to install programs with yum and dnf

To enable the user sarah to install programs on the localhost.localdomain workstation using the yum and dnf utilities with sudo privileges, use:

As root, create a new sudoers.d directory under /etc/:

# mkdir -p /etc/sudoers.d/
Create a new file in the /etc/sudoers.d directory:

# visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/sarah
The file will open automatically.

Add the following line to the /etc/sudoers.d/sarah file:

sarah localhost.localdomain = /usr/bin/yum, /usr/bin/dnf
Ensure that the two command paths are separated by a , comma followed by a space.

Optional: To receive email notifications every time the user sarah attempts to use sudo privileges, add the following lines to the file:

Defaults    mail_always
Defaults    mailto="email@domain.com"
To verify if the user sarah can run the yum command with sudo privileges, switch the account:

# su sarah -
Enter the sudo yum command:

$ sudo yum
[sudo] password for sarah:
Enter the sudo password for the user sarah.

The system displays the list of yum commands and options:

...
usage: yum [options] COMMAND
...
If you receive the sarah is not in the sudoers file. This incident will be reported. message, the configuration was not completed correctly. Ensure that you are executing this procedure as root and that you followed the steps thoroughly.
